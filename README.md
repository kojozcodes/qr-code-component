## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5 - For styles
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I have learned more about components and some of the classes to style a web page. For example: The bootstrap flexbox, sizing, spacing and some other properties.

I learned that adding ```class="d-flex"``` to an HTML tag will make that HTML element have the ```display: flex``` property. There are many more examples.

Bootstrap makes building a web page so much easier, but I believe we should solidify our CSS skills and knowledge before proceeding to use those frameworks like bootstrap.


### Continued development

I am still not completely comfortable with my bootstrap skills, so I would focus on improving. I would also keep practicing my Vanilla CSS, as I believe it would help boost my knowledge on how bootstrap works.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me learn about what each Bootstrap class does. So I would recommend you go through the docs to learn about the Bootstrap classes.
